Hard Errors
-----------
Any errors resulting from either a bad media (disk/tape etc),
(scsi/fc) protocol errors, or aborted commands (probably user induced even)
fall under the hard error category. This usually means the media is
misbehaving and probably needs to be attended to if the problem persists.
With tapes, even reading from a "Write protected" tape or a tape that
is not 'loaded' could lead to an hard error (for disks, we attempt to spin
the drive up and if it fails we report an error)

Soft Errors
-----------
We usually classify any *non serious* errors as soft errors.
For example, issuing an invalid scsi cmd (unsupported opcode) would be
classified as a soft error. Also in this category are any errors that
were corrected internally by the device (ie. bad disk remapped
successfully etc) would also be soft errors. This could sometimes mean
we should make sure we have enough alternate sectors available to
facilitate future bad sector remaps, which otherwise would lead to
*hard* errors. For tapes, soft errors could result from using block
sizes for I/O that are greater than the physical record size, reading
from blank tapes etc

Transport errors
----------------
These usually stem from errors in the 'channel' being used to issue
transport errors to the device.   For example, the cable was pulled off
(leading to transport rejected commands since the host adapter cannot
talk to the device at all). These errors could either mean a defective
cable, defective host adapter, etc.

We don't have any thresholds for these errors and leave it to the
'consumers' of these errstats to interpret the error frequencies to
take preventive action. Tapes are believed to also have some log sense
pages and some failure thresholds (defined by the tape device
manufacturers).   The tape driver uses these thresholds to issue genuine
warnings (usually something like n errors in x bytes (usually Megabytes)
read/written) like 'head cleaning required' or 'soft error rate exceeded',
etc...

What is the threshold on the Predictive Failure Analysis which should
trigger hardware replacement?

Usually this is vendor specific - They return specfic sense code (additional
sense code (ASC) of 0x5d) when pfa threshold has exceeded - These errors
are "informational".

For tapes we have 'soft error reporting' available for exabyte and dat
drives.
